			<b>Our goal is for WIC Hacks to be accessible to women with all levels of programming experience</b>.  With this goal in mind, we have compiled the below list of <b>learn-to-program resources</b>.  Although we want you to arrive at WIC Hacks with a willingness to learn, we also encourage you to check out these resources in advance of the event, particularly if you wish to use a specific language, API, framework, etc. as part of your project.  Happy learning!
